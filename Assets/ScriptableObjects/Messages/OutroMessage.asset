  messages:
  - God blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, man and
    animals
  - Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.
  - Then God promised "I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the
    intention of man's heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I ever again strike
    down every living creature as I have done."
  - THANK YOU FOR PLAYING! God Bless.
