Our entry for the [LudumDare 49 Game Jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/49/ark) where the theme was "unstable".\
We interpreted it as "The world is unstable, and God is sending a flood to destroy it. You have been commanded to gather pairs of animals and deliver them to the Ark."

## Gameplay
- Click on a person to build their path.
- Place a path next to an animal for the person to pick it up.
- Each person must gather and deliver a pair of animals onto the ark.
- Straight paths can be crossed over by holding down the left mouse button as you cross over them
